So in the middle, you see the lines sort of groupi ng the image together, \\ngrouping the image into [inaudible] regions.  \\nAnd what Ashutosh and Min did was they then  applied the learning algorithm to say can \\nwe take this clustering and us e it to build a 3D model of the world? And so using the \\nclustering, they then had a lear ning algorithm try to learn what the 3D structure of the \\nworld looks like so that they could come up with a 3D model that you can sort of fly \\nthrough, okay? Although many people used to th ink it's not possible to take a single \\nimage and build a 3D model, but using a lear ning algorithm and that sort of clustering \\nalgorithm is the first step. They were able to.  \\nI'll just show you one more example. I like this  because it's a picture of Stanford with our \\nbeautiful Stanford campus. So again, taking th e same sort of clustering algorithms, taking \\nthe same sort of unsupervised learning algor ithm, you can group the pixels into different \\nregions. And using that as a pre-processing step, they eventually built this sort of 3D model of Stanford campus in a single picture.  You can sort of walk  into the ceiling, look\")"
